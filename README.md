#Code Fellow Python Entry Test

A small python program that generates a school full of teachers and students.

It has a semi limited user interface for seeing and working with the people of the school.
You can add teachers and students but there is already a large base of data for use.
It generates at random on average roughly 300 students with teachers for each. 
It gives everyone a unique name, students get teachers and GPA's and teachers get students.

There are a few small snippets taught to me/writen by Tanner Lake noted in the code.

The lists used to generate names are linked in my documents file here:
